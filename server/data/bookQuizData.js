            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explain": "A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly into a developer console in a browser."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explain": "The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explain": "Statements like a = b * 2 are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can directly understand. So a special utility on the computer (either an interpreter or a compiler) is used to translate the code you write into commands a computer can understand. For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called interpreting the code."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explain": "It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explain": "Characters like = and * are called operators. They perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication. Variables are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in, and should be declared before they are used. In programs, variables hold values to be used by the program. By contrast to variables, literal values are the value itself. For example, 4 or 'cat' is a literal value. In other words, it stands alone without being stored in a variable."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explain": "This statement is not true, because the console can display many log() messages simultaneously (unlike the alert() method, which only displays one at a time). This is what makes console.log() a great tool for debugging your code, and for finding out what's going on under the hood."

The prompt() method returns the input value if the user clicks 'OK'. If the user clicks 'cancel' the method returns null."

            "explain": "When we use the== loose equals operator to make the comparison like '99.00' == 99.00, JavaScript will convert the left-hand side '99.00' to its number equivalent 99.00. The comparison then becomes 99.00 == 99.00, which is of course true. This is even true when the negative sign is outside of the double quotes, like so: -'99' == -99.00; . However, comparing negative and positive values returns false even when using the loose equals ==."

In the a == b comparison, JS notices that the types do not match, so it goes through an ordered series of steps to coerce one or both values to a different type until the types match, where then a simple value equality can be checked.

Instead of creating a new stack frame for the next function call, the engine just reuses the existing stack frame. That works because a function doesn't need to preserve any of the current state."
